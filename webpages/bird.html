                            Birds have a rich history that traces back to their origins as maniraptoran theropod dinosaurs during the Mesozoic era. The discovery of Archaeopteryx in the 19th century highlighted the close relationship between birds and dinosaurs. After the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event 66 million years ago, four distinct lineages of birds survived, leading to the diversity we see today, including ostriches, waterfowl, and modern birds. Overall, birds are not only descendants of ancient dinosaurs but are considered to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_birds" target="_blank">dinosaurs themselves</a>.

                        <h2>Common & Healthy Diets</h2>
                        <p>
                            No two birds are exactly alike, so there's no single perfect diet. On top of that, they tend to be very picky (and messy!) when it comes to food. However, to keep you little friend interested, offer a variety of fruits and vegetables with their meals every day. They might not eat it the same day, but it doesn't mean they won't devour it another day.
                            <br><br>
                            While their diet might be a bit more complicated than other pets, we <b>DO NOT</b> recommend feeding them the following foods:
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Avocado</b> - Contain a toxic component called "persin".</li>
                                <li><b>Caffeine</b> - Can induce arrhythmias and hyperactivity.</li>
                                <li><b>Chocolate</b> - It contains caffeine and it can lead to vomiting and diarrhea.</li>
                                <li><b>Salt</b> - Just like for humans, salt causes dehydration and kidney dysfunction.</li>
                                <li><b>Alcohol</b> - Self-explanatory!</li>

                            Your bird's health and happiness matter. Here are some of the most common challenges bird owners face 
                            and effective solutions to keep your feathered friend thriving.

                                <h3>Feather Plucking</h3>
                                <p>
                                    This is a distressing behavior that can result from stress, boredum, an unbalanced diet, or underlying health issues. Birds are highly intelligent and require mental stimulation, without it, they could resort to self-destructive behavior such as this.
                                    <br><br>
                                    To prevent feather plucking, it's crucial to create stimulating environment. Make sure you give them plenty of toys or safe wooden chews. More importantly, make sure their diet is balanced to promote healthier feathers. If your bird keeps doing this, take it to an <b>avian vet</b> who can rule out medical conditions and provide other solutions.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Screaming/Excessive Noise</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Birds are naturally vocal creatures, but excessive screaming can be a sign of attention-seeking, boredom, or frustration. As we mentioned before, birds are intelligent. If they learn that loud calls get immediate attention, they may continue this behavior.
                                    <br><br>
                                    To manage this behavior, it's important to reinforce quiet moments rather than reacting to loud outbursts. Ignoring unwanted screaming and rewarding calm behavior with treats or attention can teach your birth that quieter sounds are more effective. They also thrive on structure, so keeping a consistent schedule for playtime and social interaction can hel them feel secure.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Biting & Agression</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Aggressive behavior in birds is often rooted in fear, territorial instincts, or a lack of proper socialization. A bird may bite if they feel threatened, overwhelmed, or if their boundaries are not being respected. Hormonal changes, especially during molting or breeding seasons, can also contribute to heightened aggression.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Understanding your bird‚Äôs body language is key to preventing bites. Signs of discomfort, such as fluffed feathers, dilated pupils, or an open beak, indicate that the bird needs space. Forcing interaction can reinforce negative associations, so it‚Äôs best to build trust gradually through positive reinforcement. Offering treats and engaging in gentle, rewarding interactions can help a bird feel more comfortable and less defensive.
